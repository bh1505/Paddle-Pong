Paddle Pong aims to emulate bouncing a ping pong ball in real life, with some fun and creative twists to add a new level of interaction. The main objective of the game is too keep a ping pong ball in a series of consecutive bounces, trying to get the highest number of successful hits in a row as possible. 

To accomplish having a virtual paddle the user will move his or her phone around their relative location to transpose the ping pong paddle to the intended direction on the screen. To understand this better, if the ping ball has bounced to the top end of the screen the user should thrust their phone away from their body, in effect emulating moving a paddle forward in real life. Therefore, our app will be relying on the iPhones and iPads built in accelerometer to measure changes in velocity in the user’s relative location.  The user can think of his or her phone as the paddle, and he or she is simply moving the “paddle” to catch the ball before it falls. To add another facet to our gameplay, we have also introduced powerups and powerdowns, which upon contact will affect gameplay in a unique way. For example, a user can receive double points for successful bounces or speed up the game time so everything moves two times faster.
